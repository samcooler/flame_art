    // the way debugging works is to specify "debugpy" as the type of the launch.
    // The "python" launch type is depricated, you are supposed to use tasks.

    // Also note: it might be nice to run things like "launchpad" and "sim" automatically.
    // This is done by creating a "task" in "tasks.json" (launch sim), creating
    // it as a background task, then including "preLaunchTask" in the launch config.
    // At least, thats what chatgpt is telling me, havent tried it yet - BB
